# Urban-Heat-Index
This repository contains the work done till now for the project based on analyzing the climatic and terrestrial changes caused due to urbanization.
We are creating different indices and using them to scale the change in the vicinities in observation.

# NDVI
Normalized Difference in Vegetation Index calculates the amount and quality of vegetation present in the area using red and nir bands of Landsat images. 
The code processes these images by first aligning them, then calibrating them using radiometric calibration, and finally using the formula for NDVI. 
The output is temporarily stored in the "Output" directory under the name with the image pairs' date when they were taken.
